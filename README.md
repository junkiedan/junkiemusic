Installation guide:

* Download and install nodejs and npm on your computer.
  For more information click this [link](https://nodejs.org/).

* Download and install ffmpeg module in your computer. This program is required
  because to play a song from youtube we convert the video in mp3 and we
  download it. So we need ffmpeg to execute the .mp3 file.
  For more information click this [link](http://ffmpeg.org/).

* When you have finished setting up your project go inside the MusicJunkie
  folder using a terminal window. Being inside the folder type in terminal the
  following command: "node index.js". The bot should be up and running. You can
  see that bot started without any occuring problems by checking your terminal.
  The bot should log the following: "JunkieMusic is running. Version X.X.X".
