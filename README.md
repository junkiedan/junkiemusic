#   Discord Music Bot - JunkieMusic     
##  Created by JunkieDan - version 0.0.1  

This is a discord youtube music bot. This bot has bad manners and flames the users a lot.
It was created so that you can have fun with your friends in your discord server.
The bot is not complete and it has some bugs. Also it uses embeds so the messages are polite.

Available commands:

* -play or -p to play a song.

* -next or -n to skip a song.

* -stop or -s to stop the song list.

* -ping for pongs.

* -help or -h for basic user help.

* -queue to see the songs queue track by track.

* -remove [#] to remove a song from the queue.

Installation guide:

* Download and install nodejs and npm on your computer.
  For more information click this [link](https://nodejs.org/).

* Download and install ffmpeg module in your computer. This program is required
  because to play a song from youtube we convert the video in mp3 and we
  download it. So we need ffmpeg to execute the .mp3 file.
  For more information click this [link](http://ffmpeg.org/).

* When you have finished setting up your project go inside the MusicJunkie
  folder using a terminal window. Being inside the folder type in terminal the
  following command: "node index.js". The bot should be up and running. You can
  see that bot started without any occuring problems by checking your terminal.
  The bot should log the following: "JunkieMusic is running. Version X.X.X".
  
* Node version 12.16.2 - Discord.js version 12.0.2 - FFmpeg version 4.2.2
