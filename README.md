Installation guide:

* Download and install nodejs and npm on your computer.
  For more information click this [link](https://nodejs.org/).

* Download and install ffmpeg module in your computer. This program is required
  because to play a song from youtube we convert the video in mp3 and we
  download it. So we need ffmpeg to execute the .mp3 file.

  following command: "node index.js". The bot should be up and running. You can
